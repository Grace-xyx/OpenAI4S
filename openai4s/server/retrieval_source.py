"""The retrieval provenance a client is allowed to see.

`artifact_versions.source` records where retrieved data came from: the
database, the request URL, the query, when it happened, per-response hashes.
It has never been sent to a client, and it should be — "this figure is built on
data fetched from UniProt at 14:02, and here is the hash of what came back" is
the difference between a plot and a result.

But it cannot be sent as it stands, for three reasons that are each enough on
their own:

1. **A request URL carries credentials.** Plenty of scientific APIs take the
   key in the query string, and this envelope is written by whatever code did
   the retrieval — including a skill nobody has audited. Rendering it raw would
   publish an API key into the UI and into every stored frame that quotes it.
2. **The envelope is open-ended.** It is written as free-form JSON by the
   retrieval site, so "show the envelope" means showing whatever some future
   caller decided to put there. An allowlist is the only version of this that
   stays true as the callers change.
3. **It is unbounded.** A query can be a 200 KB POST body. A panel is not a
   place to discover that.

So: allowlist the keys, bound every value, and redact inside URLs and text
rather than trusting the whole-value check — a key in a query parameter sits in
the middle of a long string, which `redact` alone reads as "not opaque".
