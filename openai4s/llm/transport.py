"""Pure-stdlib HTTP transports used by the LLM provider adapters.

Failures here are typed (see ``TransportError``) rather than flattened into a
message string, which is what makes a bounded retry possible at all: a 429 with
a ``Retry-After`` is now distinguishable from a 401 without parsing English.

The retry policy is deliberately narrow:

  * only statuses that are retryable *and* whose request committed nothing —
    a whole-response POST can be replayed; a stream that already delivered
    events cannot, because the caller has seen those bytes;
  * bounded attempts with exponential backoff and jitter (many clients hitting
    one rate-limited endpoint must not resynchronise on the same schedule);
  * ``Retry-After`` wins over the computed backoff when the server sent one;
  * cancellable between attempts, so a user's Stop is not held hostage by a
    sleep; and
  * a total budget, so a long Retry-After cannot silently park a turn for
    minutes.
