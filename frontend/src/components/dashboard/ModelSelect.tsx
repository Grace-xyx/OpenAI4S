 * `window.loadModels` bridge could fill, and nothing assigned one: the control
 * was a chevron with zero options.
 *
 * It shows the model the open session is pinned to, not the server default:
 * a session runs on its own pin, so showing the default there named a model
 * the conversation was not using. A pin no entry can stand for (a deleted
 * profile, an earlier revision of a listed one) is a disabled placeholder.
 * A change re-pins that session (and makes the choice the default for new
 * ones) through `chooseComposerModel`.
